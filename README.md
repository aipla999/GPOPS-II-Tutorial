Examples used in a GPOPS-II tutorial

Enter `run addmiscellaneousPath` to add the miscellaneous folder to the path. This contains functions that are necessary to plot the example outputs successfully.

The tutorial uses examples to explain basic concepts in trajectory optimization, and how to implement using GPOPS-II. Topics covered include:

- What is trajectory optimization and direct collocation?
- What are states and dynamics?
- What are controls?
- Variable Bounds: GPOPS-II syntax
- Continuous and Endpoint functions
- Multi-phase optimization
- Endpoint constraints
- Free parameters
